# Running the game

The game is compiled for windows x86-64 systems.

You should be able to run it on most windows devices by opening the executable. You can [download it from itch.io](https://boopdood.itch.io/exercise-your-demons).

The executable is not properly signed so you have to bypass the windows warning for the game to start.

## Game Controls

- Movement: WASD or Arrow Keys
- Interact: E, Enter or mouse click
- Buttons: Mouse click
- Quit: ESC

# Project Files
