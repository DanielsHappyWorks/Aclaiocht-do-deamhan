    "section": "Characters",
    "text": "Characters\nThis section describes all the characters and their stories.\n\nMain Character\nWhile not acknowledged at first, the main character is a changeling that has completed their purpose in life. They are searching for something new now as they grow into adulthood and move out to live on their own. In their past life, they replaced one of two twins that passed away in a car accident with their parents. It was an act of kindness to help the parents cope with their loss. This act of kindness is the reason why they are a fitting main character for this story.\nSince they are a changeling, the player gets to choose if they are a male or female twin.\n They want to fit in and find a place to belong. So far, they have been struggling to maintain a job but have managed to find a place at the gym in a small town outside of Galway by recommendation of their uncle, Colin. The family they have been a part of wants to see them succeed. Their goal is to make them proud by living a happy life but so far, it’s been difficult due to being a changeling.\nThroughout the story, they struggle with anxiety about the move but as the days go by, they seem to look forward to all of the interactions with the other characters. They make some friends and decide to take over the management of the gym from Paddy to help others find their way as they stumble in and out of town.\nPaddy’s retirement from the gym causes conflict as the character’s cozy new life is thrown for a loop! Interactions with other characters slowly reveal the fact that you’re a changeling throughout the game.\n\nMain Character\nHow does this relate to the relevant research question “How can Irish Folklore teach lessons of modern day struggles through narrative gaming”?\n\nThe changeling has been raised by a good family and is trying to make them proud. However, it goes against their nature, so they are struggling.\nThe overarching story is of a modern day struggle to fit into society while fighting internal anxieties and inner demons.\nCreatures from Irish folklore are used to drive the character narrative forward with lessons of their own.\n\n\n\n\nSide Characters\nThere are multiple characters that the player gets to meet throughout the narrative. The player’s goal is to meet and help them with their issues. If the player succeeds, they will grow themselves and hopefully find their goal in life. Since we’re dealing with fairies who are known to be tricksters and sometimes even bad omens, all bad endings lead to the main character’s death which needs to be avoided if you want to see the good ending.\n\nSt Patrick\nThis is the mentor character on our main character’s Hero’s Journey. He guides the main character in his daily duties and introduces all the good people the main character will need to befriend. He is also the proud owner of a local pub called Paddy’s Pub.\n\n\n\nPooka\nThe Pooka is a well known trickster who takes many forms. In this game, he will take the appearance of a goblin. His story will focus on trying to influence the character into making bad decisions. The main character needs to keep him from succeeding if they are to become better creatures.\n\nGood Ending – The Pooka transforms into a black steed and takes the player out for a ride. They are speedy but careful and the ride ends with the Pooka granting the player some hidden knowledge while they stargaze together.\nBad Ending – Learning nothing of manners and morality, the player rides the Pooka in horse form off a cliff reaching a dead end. The last thing you see is the Pooka’s sinister grin atop the cliff as you fall to your doom.\n\n\nBanshee\nThe Banshee’s story is one of fear and communication problems. She is clumsy and doesn’t really have a way with words. All her life, she has been trying to save humans from themselves but can’t seem to communicate this in the right way to anyone. As you get to know her, she starts trying to make friends with all of the other creatures too.\n\nGood Ending – You and the others watch the Banshee sing at the pub. Its not perfect but its pleasant to the ears. The happy Banshee thanks you all and fades away with a smile. Her performance had saved someone from their fate which she had premonitions about, setting her free.\nBad Ending – You find the Banshee crying on the street after the main character misses her performance, which seems to have gone awry. She’s weeping for you, having seen a pre-cognition of your demise with no way to stop it. She runs off in tears and as you make your way back home a car swerves and crashes into you, taking your life.\n\n\nDullahan\nThe Dullahan is a stuck-up god of death with a knack for losing her head. She recounts stories of her past travels and asks the player for their opinions. This is a story of reflection which is something the Dullahan doesn’t seem to have a grasp on.\n\nGood Ending – You find the Dullahan’s head on the side of the foot path. This reminds you of a chilling story the Dullahan talked about having her head stolen by humans. She shows up and is hesitant, before she acts you tell her you found her head, dust it off and hand it over. She thanks you and you proceed to chat for a while. She tells you about her success with dealing with her father.\nBad Ending – As you turn around to face the Dullahan after picking her head up, you see she seems off. Something bad happened and she’s out for blood. She proceeds to swiftly take your head and rides off into the night continuing to kill for the rest of eternity."

    "text": "This week was mostly spent designing the 2D assets. I have made a decision to use physical media scans as the assets in the game. This provided a cool effect for the prototype and I can build on top of that. All assets are colored in using paint markers which gives them a nice mat finish.\nSince there is a lot of time constraints for this project I will limit the amount of assets I make and try to re-use as much as possible. This will likely mean no fully animated characters either. For now I expect they will waddle around like South Park characters with limited movement. Time constraints are forcing me to get creative here.\n\nCharacters\nAfter much deliberation I have settled on the core cast of the game. This includes:\n\nMain Character\nSt Patrick\nPooka\nBanshee\nDullahan\n\nThe cast is still mostly lacking proper names but they will interact in a small fictitious town called Inishsióg in county Galway.\nAs part of the Design Document I hope to further refine these.\nThe main character can be either male or female, the designs are:\n\nThe side character designs are:\n   \n\n\nEnvironment\nThe map is one of a coastal area.\n\nAll of the buildings will be separate sprites layered on top of the map. This way they can be highlighted using code later."

    "text": "The research question started as “How can Irish Fairies and Folklore be used to create a complex character driven narrative emphasizing self-improvement?” at the start of the semester.\nThe goal of this research is to extract lessons we can teach in a narrative game around self-improvement. It will cover the following topics to feed the game narrative and evaluate the success of the research that influences the narrative:\n\nIrish Fairies and Folklore\nCharacter driven narrative\nSelf-improvement\n\nThis is a lot to cover and the core of what I am looking into is not very well defined. To try and refine the question, I did some brainstorming and landed on the following changes:\n\nAlternative versions:\n\nIn what ways can self-improvement evolve a narrative centered around Irish fairies and folklore?\nHow can the Irish Myths and Folklore improve a narrative that focuses on the lead character’s personal growth?\nHow can Irish fairy tales and folklore be adapted into a modern narrative that is relevant to the struggles of our every day lives?\n\nMuch Different Ideas:\n\nCan an in-house narrative-focused game engine streamline our game development process?\nHow can generative AI be used to create a narrative unique to each user’s interests while following a core set of themes?\n\n\nAlternative version number 3 stood out to myself and my thesis supervisors. It’s closer to the core of what this research aims to accomplish, Which is to extract lessons we can learn from Irish Myths & Legends as narrative elements to educate players, particularly in the areas of personal growth, self-improvement and self-care.\nAfter a bit more tinkering, I landed on “What lessons can we adapt from Irish Folklore into a modern video game narrative about the struggles of everyday life?” which is a bit wordy but more fit for purpose.\nAs of this date, it’s been simplified to “How can Irish Folklore teach lessons of modern day struggles through narrative gaming?”. Big kudos to a close friend who helped in this endeavor.\nMy initial pre-conceptions led me to believe we will be discussing lessons on Morality, Karma, Courage and Loyalty."

    "text": "This week I managed to add 2 features to the game: the character selection and player movement on the overworld.\n\nCharacter Selection\nThe character selection uses UI elements from Raygui which made the development a lot faster. The visuals on this menu could use some work and maybe revisited in the future if time allows but the menu itself serves its purpose.\nWhile re-watching the demo below, I realised I tried to click on the character directly to select them. I may also need to reconsider some usability aspects of my UI design.\n\n\nPlayer Movement\nThe player movement works well. The animations can definitely be refined. The glaring issue I’ll have to come back to here is re-using the movement in location scenes as currently all code lives in the overworld scene. Small steps will get me where I need to go eventually.\n\n\nShort Reflection\nTo challenge myself, I decided to use raylib with C++ for the project. Using an engine would probably have been a bit faster in retrospect but this is keeping me engaged in the technical aspects. So far, the coding is fun and not too challenging. It was a good idea to focus the thesis on an area I’m less versed in. It helps that I’m already somewhat familiar with raylib through my other project called House of Cards.\nAs I add more, I’m continuously re-factoring and find myself spending a lot of time cleaning up after myself due to some questionable code choices. Time constraints are forcing me to be creative and take some shortcuts so I can keep making visible progress but that seems to be the thing that drives me into a corner causing said re-factors.\n\n\nFirst steps towards a narrative game\nThe first steps have been taken towards being able to create a narrative game. I still need to do some work around entering locations and spawning NPCs but once this is done I can start working on dialogue engine implementation.\nHere is a quick demo of the game so far."
