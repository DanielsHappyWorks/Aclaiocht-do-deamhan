    "text": "Characters\nThis section describes all the characters and their stories.\n\nMain Character\nWhile not acknowledged at first, the main character is a changeling that has completed their purpose in life. They are searching for something new now as they grow into adulthood and move out to live on their own. In their past life, they replaced one of two twins that passed away in a car accident with their parents. It was an act of kindness to help the parents cope with their loss. This act of kindness is the reason why they are a fitting main character for this story.\nSince they are a changeling, the player gets to choose if they are a male or female twin.\n They want to fit in and find a place to belong. So far, they have been struggling to maintain a job but have managed to find a place at the gym in a small town outside of Galway by recommendation of their uncle, Colin. The family they have been a part of wants to see them succeed. Their goal is to make them proud by living a happy life but so far, it’s been difficult due to being a changeling.\nThroughout the story, they struggle with anxiety about the move but as the days go by, they seem to look forward to all of the interactions with the other characters. They make some friends and decide to take over the management of the gym from Paddy to help others find their way as they stumble in and out of town.\nPaddy’s retirement from the gym causes conflict as the character’s cozy new life is thrown for a loop! Interactions with other characters slowly reveal the fact that you’re a changeling throughout the game.\n\nMain Character\nHow does this relate to the relevant research question “How can Irish Folklore teach lessons of modern day struggles through narrative gaming”?\n\nThe changeling has been raised by a good family and is trying to make them proud. However, it goes against their nature, so they are struggling.\nThe overarching story is of a modern day struggle to fit into society while fighting internal anxieties and inner demons.\nCreatures from Irish folklore are used to drive the character narrative forward with lessons of their own.\n\n\n\n\nSide Characters\nThere are multiple characters that the player gets to meet throughout the narrative. The player’s goal is to meet and help them with their issues. If the player succeeds, they will grow themselves and hopefully find their goal in life. Since we’re dealing with fairies who are known to be tricksters and sometimes even bad omens, all bad endings lead to the main character’s death which needs to be avoided if you want to see the good ending.\n\nSt Patrick\nThis is the mentor character on our main character’s Hero’s Journey. He guides the main character in his daily duties and introduces all the good people the main character will need to befriend. He is also the proud owner of a local pub called Paddy’s Pub.\n\n\n\nPooka\nThe Pooka is a well known trickster who takes many forms. In this game, he will take the appearance of a goblin. His story will focus on trying to influence the character into making bad decisions. The main character needs to keep him from succeeding if they are to become better creatures.\n\nGood Ending – The Pooka transforms into a black steed and takes the player out for a ride. They are speedy but careful and the ride ends with the Pooka granting the player some hidden knowledge while they stargaze together.\nBad Ending – Learning nothing of manners and morality, the player rides the Pooka in horse form off a cliff reaching a dead end. The last thing you see is the Pooka’s sinister grin atop the cliff as you fall to your doom.\n\n\nBanshee\nThe Banshee’s story is one of fear and communication problems. She is clumsy and doesn’t really have a way with words. All her life, she has been trying to save humans from themselves but can’t seem to communicate this in the right way to anyone. As you get to know her, she starts trying to make friends with all of the other creatures too.\n\nGood Ending – You and the others watch the Banshee sing at the pub. Its not perfect but its pleasant to the ears. The happy Banshee thanks you all and fades away with a smile. Her performance had saved someone from their fate which she had premonitions about, setting her free.\nBad Ending – You find the Banshee crying on the street after the main character misses her performance, which seems to have gone awry. She’s weeping for you, having seen a pre-cognition of your demise with no way to stop it. She runs off in tears and as you make your way back home a car swerves and crashes into you, taking your life.\n\n\nDullahan\nThe Dullahan is a stuck-up god of death with a knack for losing her head. She recounts stories of her past travels and asks the player for their opinions. This is a story of reflection which is something the Dullahan doesn’t seem to have a grasp on.\n\nGood Ending – You find the Dullahan’s head on the side of the foot path. This reminds you of a chilling story the Dullahan talked about having her head stolen by humans. She shows up and is hesitant, before she acts you tell her you found her head, dust it off and hand it over. She thanks you and you proceed to chat for a while. She tells you about her success with dealing with her father.\nBad Ending – As you turn around to face the Dullahan after picking her head up, you see she seems off. Something bad happened and she’s out for blood. She proceeds to swiftly take your head and rides off into the night continuing to kill for the rest of eternity."

    "text": "This week was mostly spent designing the 2D assets. I have made a decision to use physical media scans as the assets in the game. This provided a cool effect for the prototype and I can build on top of that. All assets are colored in using paint markers which gives them a nice mat finish.\nSince there is a lot of time constraints for this project I will limit the amount of assets I make and try to re-use as much as possible. This will likely mean no fully animated characters either. For now I expect they will waddle around like South Park characters with limited movement. Time constraints are forcing me to get creative here.\n\nCharacters\nAfter much deliberation I have settled on the core cast of the game. This includes:\n\nMain Character\nSt Patrick\nPooka\nBanshee\nDullahan\n\nThe cast is still mostly lacking proper names but they will interact in a small fictitious town called Inishsióg in county Galway.\nAs part of the Design Document I hope to further refine these.\nThe main character can be either male or female, the designs are:\n\nThe side character designs are:\n   \n\n\nEnvironment\nThe map is one of a coastal area.\n\nAll of the buildings will be separate sprites layered on top of the map. This way they can be highlighted using code later."

    "text": "The research question started as “How can Irish Fairies and Folklore be used to create a complex character driven narrative emphasizing self-improvement?” at the start of the semester.\nThe goal of this research is to extract lessons we can teach in a narrative game around self-improvement. It will cover the following topics to feed the game narrative and evaluate the success of the research that influences the narrative:\n\nIrish Fairies and Folklore\nCharacter driven narrative\nSelf-improvement\n\nThis is a lot to cover and the core of what I am looking into is not very well defined. To try and refine the question, I did some brainstorming and landed on the following changes:\n\nAlternative versions:\n\nIn what ways can self-improvement evolve a narrative centered around Irish fairies and folklore?\nHow can the Irish Myths and Folklore improve a narrative that focuses on the lead character’s personal growth?\nHow can Irish fairy tales and folklore be adapted into a modern narrative that is relevant to the struggles of our every day lives?\n\nMuch Different Ideas:\n\nCan an in-house narrative-focused game engine streamline our game development process?\nHow can generative AI be used to create a narrative unique to each user’s interests while following a core set of themes?\n\n\nAlternative version number 3 stood out to myself and my thesis supervisors. It’s closer to the core of what this research aims to accomplish, Which is to extract lessons we can learn from Irish Myths & Legends as narrative elements to educate players, particularly in the areas of personal growth, self-improvement and self-care.\nAfter a bit more tinkering, I landed on “What lessons can we adapt from Irish Folklore into a modern video game narrative about the struggles of everyday life?” which is a bit wordy but more fit for purpose.\nAs of this date, it’s been simplified to “How can Irish Folklore teach lessons of modern day struggles through narrative gaming?”. Big kudos to a close friend who helped in this endeavor.\nMy initial pre-conceptions led me to believe we will be discussing lessons on Morality, Karma, Courage and Loyalty."

GYM - DAY - TRIGGER: Character Creation Completed\nPlays after the character creation acting as a tutorial for the game while introducing the PLAYER to ST. PADDY, their new job and the banshee. The PLAYER is limited to working at this time.\n\nPLAYER\nFinally arrived. Uncle Colin really pulled through for me here. Not sure I could have landed this gig without him. Better make sure to thank him soon. ’Tis been hard the last few weeks.\nST. PADDY\nAhh you finally made it. The name is Paddy. I’m the manager of this here joint. Tír na Sioga we call it.\nPLAYER\nI’m {{NAME}}, thank you for taking me on on such short notice.\nST. PADDY\nLooking forward to having you on board.\nColin said it’s your first time coming to Inishsióg.\nGood chap that one. What are your thoughts on the place so far? We have some good folk here; I’m sure you’ll all get along.\nPLAYER\nLand of the Fairies on Fairy Island, what a name! I hope this place isn’t filled with nutcases.\nOnly had a quick look around after the boat from Galway arrived. Seems a nice and quaint island.\nST. PADDY\nIt’s about time we get some help around here.\nGrand, let’s put you right to work so.\nPLAYER\nNeed to put my best foot forward here, can’t put this opportunity to waste.\nSounds good, where should I start?\nST. PADDY\nGrand, you’re going to work with some fairly odd folk here but they are good at heart.\nAll ya need to do is chat and help ’em out. You’ll get paid for any day or night shift ya take on.\nMake sure to treat ’em well, they need good people to spend some time with.\nPLAYER\nUgh, I was hoping for a more low-key role here. Blending in with the wallpaper would be nice. Meeting new people is a real tough ask but I can’t let me family down again.\nOk, I’ll do my best.\nST. PADDY\nYou sure you’re up for this? Ya seem a bit pale.\nPLAYER\nYep, leave it to me!\nST. PADDY\nAlright, we don’t get many people in here. It’s rare to see more than one person come in sometimes.\nSeems like today Chaointe Doran dropped by. She’s a timid spirit that struggles with conversation but she really likes to talk.\nIf you take it slow, I’m sure she’ll warm up to ya in no time.\nPLAYER\nWow shes a looker but she does seem fidgety about my presence here. If Paddy didn’t point her out I’m not sure I’d have seen her. Her presence seems so faint.\nST. PADDY\nThe people she gets to know don’t stick around for long so take care to be a good attentive person she can lean on.\nPLAYER\nThe way he said that first part sent chills down my spine. ’Tis odd but it can’t be that bad right?\nST. PADDY\nYour job today is to introduce yourself and help her out. O’ am countin’ on ya, good luck kid.\nTake care now, am off to cater my pride and joy so. Oh ho ho! Paddy’s Pub we’ll make you great again now that I have more time.\nPLAYER\nPaddy waddled off humming such a joyful tune; I wonder what it was. Alright time to get to it. It’s not like Chaointe bites, right?!\n\nThe next day they will have a choice of where they want to head during the day.\n\n\n\nINT. GYM - DAY/NIGHT - TRIGGER: Entered the gym to work a second time\nThe Player enters the Gym to work for a second time. St. Paddy introduces the second character who is a pooka.\n\nST. PADDY\nWelcome back, good to have ya here again. Ready for another day at work?\nPLAYER\nHe sounds way too happy to see me. Something tells me he’s about to run off again and leave me to deal with the shortie in the corner.\nAye Aye Captain!\nST. PADDY\nLovely enthusiasm! I see you’re already staring down Monsieur Púca Cleasaí.\nYa know it’s rude to stare, right, tho he’d do the same. All I can do is hope you’re not two peas in a pod.\nHe’s a bit of a trickster you see. Whatever you do, don’t let him push you about, OK?.\nPLAYER\nI nodded back at Paddy and wondered if this guy might be a kindred spirit.\nST. PADDY\nWith this one, you have to make sure you don’t let the peer pressure get to you. Don’t want to do things you’ll regret after all.\nIf you’re not up for this your always free to leave and come back another day.\nAlright, am off to my home sweet home for a pint.\nPLAYER\nWhat a man, so much joy but he’s only got the pub on his mind. I wonder if I’ll ever have a place like that.\nSee you soon boss!\n\nYou now have the choice of working or doing something else entirely. Walking into a location will not lock you out of doing other things anymore.\n\n\n\nINT. GYM - DAY/NIGHT - TRIGGER: Entered the gym to work a third time\nThe Player enters the Gym to work for a third time. St. Paddy introduces the third character who is a dullahan. The scene is a bit tense as this is is the first time the player outright finds out the people here aren’t human.\n\nPLAYER\nA-Ahhh, t-that parson’s h-head i-is…\nBefore I could finish my sentence, Paddy put his hand over my mouth to stop me. All I could see was the severed head glaring at me from a distance.\nST. PADDY\nC’mere to me, whatever you’re about to yell, stuff it down deep and don’t. We don’t need this beautiful day going arseways.\nPLAYER\nI gulped, holding my fear back. Paddy’s demeanour shifted from the usual happy go lucky caring self. What is this, should I leg it while I still can?\nST. PADDY\nCalm down kid, I’m sure you’ve realized it by know. Everyone who comes here ain’t exactly human but they are good people.\nOur little lady over there is the headless rider herself, Crom Dubh. Try not to cross her as she’s got a tendency for violence.\nPLAYER\nPaddy is right, I already knew this place was odd. Knowing I’m not seeing a dead body has put me slightly at ease.\nST. PADDY\nYeah, you’ll be fine. Today might be a tough day on the job but you’ve got this, after all you already meet some inhuman guests of ours. Just make sure to apologize for that outburst.\nPLAYER\nI guess I’m gonna need to figure out whats up with this town. It’s so odd that I may just fit right in. These misfits may be my kind of odd but should I really be here?\nW-will do. Sorry for making things uncomfortable.\nST. PADDY\n’Tis grand, reflecting on and rectifying our mistakes is important.\nI’ll leave ya to it so. Am off to take care of da pub.\nPLAYER\nNo humming today. I really soured the mood. Not a great way to start another day on the job. I should at least go and apologize.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayer Events\n\nINT. HOME - MORNING - TRIGGER: Morning after meeting the banshee\nThe PLAYER reflects on their meeting with CHAOINTE.\n\nGood Choice\n\nPLAYER\nI woke up early with my muscles aching from the exercise. It feels good to have exercised yesterday. The sleep felt so much better than usual.\nChaointe was so nice. I should make sure to exercise with her again soon. I really got to learn more from her if I’m going to do a good job at the gym.\nAlright! Time to put this new found energy to good use. Should I go to work or visit the town? Paddy doesn’t seem to mind which shifts I take.\n\n\n\nBad Choice\n\nPLAYER\nI woke up early with my muscles aching from the exercise. My sleep was awful and I’m aching so much.\nI still feel weird about the interaction I’ve had with Chaointe. Maybe I can still make it up to her.\nEhhh, I guess I should get up and try to get out of bed. The parents would be so disappointed If I failed at another job.

We got to clean some stuff that doesn’t usually get done.\n\n\n\n\nBad Choice\n\nPLAYER\nThat little garden gnome of a man had me doing too much extra work last night. I can’t believe I spent so much extra time cleaning up that mess on my own.\nI hope Paddy isn’t too annoyed with the slight re-modelling. I couldn’t fix it all alone.\n\n\n\n\n\nINT.

How can I help you today?\nCHAOINTE\nH-Hi, I-I’m C-Chaointe Doran. It’s nice to meet you {{NAME}}. I’m here to work out. W-would you like to join me please?\nPLAYER\nYeah sure.\nWe started our workout. An uncomfortable silence loomed over us and the exercising feels excruciating. Chaointe is fidgety and looks like she has something to say but isn’t comfortable. I should break the silence.\n\n\nPLAYER CHOICE: As I keep going, I blurt out:\n\nA. This exercise is tough. How are you managing?\n\nCHAOINTE\nI’m doing well b-but you seem to be struggling a bit. Y-Your form is off. You don’t do this often, do you?\nPLAYER\nYeah you’re right, I don’t work out much so I may not be the best option to look after this place.\nCHAOINTE\nDon’t worry, it will take some effort but I’m sure you’ll improve in no time.\nPLAYER\nChaointe helped me improve my form and as we continued to exercise, it was exhausting but it felt much better.\nThanks so much, this feels a lot better now.\nCHAOINTE\nN-no problem. Thanks for working out with me. L-let’s do it again.\nPLAYER\nLooking forward to it. See you soon.\nChaointe left with a spring in her step. I finish cleaning up and head home to sleep\n\n\n\nB. Whats up? Spit it out already!\n\nCHAOINTE\nI-it’s n-nothing. I’m so s-sorry.\nPLAYER\nNo need to apologize. Let’s keep pumping iron.\nThe awkward silence continued for the remainder of the workout. I’m exhausted and aching all over.\nPhew, glad that’s done.\nCHAOINTE\nY-yeah, I need to head off now. Bye.\nPLAYER\nChaointe left swiftly, leaving me wondering what she had to say.

It’d be nice to have his confidence.\nYeah, started recently and am here to help you out if needed.\nPUCA\nGood stuff. Since yar here to help, lets sort this here mess out. This gym could use a slight re-modelling to improve the layout. Dear Paddy has too much on his head so this I’ll make his life easier.\nPLAYER\nThe commandeering Púca didn’t need to convince me. I got swooped up by his charisma and didn’t think to question him at all.\nAlright, lets get to work.\nPUCA\nGood lad. Let’s do this!\nPLAYER\nWe painstakingly moved everything at the gym at Púca’s whim. What seemed a good idea initially turned into a big mess. I looked around and everything was placed haphazardly. A beautiful gym got turned into a tripping hazard on my watch.\n\n\nPLAYER CHOICE: What should I do now?\n\nA. Stop this madness and fix everything even though it will take a long time.\n\nPLAYER\nThis isn’t working. We should stop and put it all back as it was before.\nPUCA\nB-But its so much fun messing with Paddy like this.\nPLAYER\nMessing?! Have some cop on! That’s not how we should treat people!\nMy mind was rushing. I don’t like confrontation. Púca seemed impressed that I stood up to him as if he was messing with me and not Paddy.\nPUCA\nAlright, alright. Let’s sort this out, so. T’was fun while it lasted.\nPLAYER\nThanks.\nWe worked hard to fix the mess. It took longer than expected but the place was cleaner than before we started.\n\n\n\nB. Keep going to avoid confronting Mr. Púca.\n\nPLAYER\nWe continued to work. The mess became worse. I’m in for it now. It’s time to wrap this up before it gets even worse.\nThere this should do it.\nPUCA\nYeah, fine work today.\nPúca was grinning at me. He knows exactly what we had done here yet he also seems to be unsatisfied. Maybe I should have stopped him. I’ll tidy the place up before I head off for the day.\n\n\n\nCommon Dialog Post Decision\n\nPUCA\nThat was hard work lad. Let’s have some fun again sometime.

So what do you need?\n\n\nPLAYER CHOICE: Crom doesn’t seem too worried about my outburst. What should I do?\n\nA. Apologise, reflecting on your moment of panic.\n\nPLAYER\nI’m so sorry about my panicked outburst earlier. I assumed the worst. I thought someone had died.\nCROM\nInteresting, people usually jump like that from fear when they see me.\nPLAYER\nWell there was probably a small bit of that too when I seen you move.\nCROM\nThat’s OK, you seem like an honest fellow. You also took the time to apologise to me too.\nPLAYER\nThanks for being so accepting of my mistake. It won’t happen again.\nCROM\nNo problem. I do love a good jump scare. T’was a bit of fun.\nPLAYER\nThe apology went well. It seems like Crom is well used to this kind of thing. Makes me wonder what kind of life she must lead.\nDo you need help with anything today?\nCROM\nNo, just wrapping up my exercises. I’ll be done and gone soon. Let’s chat again some other day.\nPLAYER\nSounds good.\nI left Crom to her own devices while I tidied up and filled out some paperwork. Once she left, I wrapped up too.\n\n\n\nB.

I owe him a debt of gratitude so I’ll let this one slide.\nI’m heading off before anything else comes out of that fun-sized brain of yours.\nPLAYER\nCrom stomped away while I stood there in silence to avoid making things worse.

    "section": "",
    "text": "This week I managed to add 2 features to the game: the character selection and player movement on the overworld.\n\nCharacter Selection\nThe character selection uses UI elements from Raygui which made the development a lot faster. The visuals on this menu could use some work and maybe revisited in the future if time allows but the menu itself serves its purpose.\nWhile re-watching the demo below, I realised I tried to click on the character directly to select them. I may also need to reconsider some usability aspects of my UI design.\n\n\nPlayer Movement\nThe player movement works well. The animations can definitely be refined. The glaring issue I’ll have to come back to here is re-using the movement in location scenes as currently all code lives in the overworld scene. Small steps will get me where I need to go eventually.\n\n\nShort Reflection\nTo challenge myself, I decided to use raylib with C++ for the project. Using an engine would probably have been a bit faster in retrospect but this is keeping me engaged in the technical aspects. So far, the coding is fun and not too challenging. It was a good idea to focus the thesis on an area I’m less versed in. It helps that I’m already somewhat familiar with raylib through my other project called House of Cards.\nAs I add more, I’m continuously re-factoring and find myself spending a lot of time cleaning up after myself due to some questionable code choices. Time constraints are forcing me to be creative and take some shortcuts so I can keep making visible progress but that seems to be the thing that drives me into a corner causing said re-factors.\n\n\nFirst steps towards a narrative game\nThe first steps have been taken towards being able to create a narrative game. I still need to do some work around entering locations and spawning NPCs but once this is done I can start working on dialogue engine implementation.\nHere is a quick demo of the game so far."

PADDY\nWith this one you have to make sure you don’t let the peer pressure get to you. Don’t want to do things you’ll regret after all.\nIf your not up for this your always free to leave and come back another day.\nAlright, am off to my home sweet home for a pint.\nPLAYER\nWhat a man, so much joy but hes only got the pub on his mind.

It felt like I was not making any progress so I took some time here and there to add some flare to the game.\nHere is a demo of the visuals so far:\n\n\nCharacter Animations\nCharacter animations without animated sprites was a challenge. The character’s pivot point needed to change but Raylib didn’t support this so I extended texture drawing to support this. I’m very happy with this.\n\nOnce this was done, making the character squish and stretch and rotate over time was simple. I still need to extend this to texture boundaries to make collisions simpler when drawing using pivots but this can be done later as needed.\n\n\nCharacter Selection\nReusing the pivot work from the character animation, I added a sun and clouds to the character select which was now also re-purposed into the main menu. This was simple enough but it did so much towards making the menu much more professional.\n\n\nGame Locations\nAll locations have different backgrounds now so they are easier to tell apart. This makes testing easier. The locations are still missing items but that’s refinement work for the beta stage of the project.\n\n\nAudio Improvements\nI added an audio manager with music made by Joel Steudler. This actually helped me in the narrative engine as now I can change music in scenes to match the mood. This has added some much needed depth to my game. Sound effects still need to be implemented but the audio manager has support for these, making my life easier in the future."

My goal is to refine this in the beta dev cycle. I took a stab at this already but needed to move on as the script is not fully integrated yet and that takes priority."

    "text": "The narrative script scoped for the beta release is now fully integrated into my game. I’m satisfied with how this came out. The narrative engine made this easy and quick. Unlike the first few dialogue events this only took about 2 hours including bug fixing. The actual narrative integration probably only took 45 min which speaks volumes for how robust and extendable this game is.\nI do worry that the focus on the character introductions may not be enough to answer my research question though which is something I need to take up with my supervisors. This may need to be listed as a limitation in the thesis if I don’t find a way forward.\n\nBugs\nI encountered some bugs in the narrative engine while doing this work. All of these were minor and easy to fix. These included:\n\nGym location events triggering where paddy is located due to paddy being wrongly assigned these events.\nCharacter events skipped conditional checks under specific circumstances which turned out to be a missing if statement.\nGlitches with special characters in text not displaying correctly."

    "text": "Fonts are hard but they are important to branding. Choosing the right one is always tough. Programming with fonts can also be difficult. I spent some time trying to find the right one and even more time getting it to work with Irish special characters (á, Á, ó, Ó, ú, Ú, í, Í, é, É).\n\nConsidered Options\nFonts that didn’t support the special characters were out straight away. I used the site fontsc to find my options. This already limits the pool of fonts significantly but it has to be done to fully display my narrative script. It’s a pity because some of these fonts were much nicer like the Celtic by Sam Wang.\n   \n\n\nFinal Choices\nI chose Vinque for headers as it doesn’t have the best support for things like italics and Erin Go Bragh as it was the font that best supports my use cases for displaying text while looking good and being readable. Between these who I have all I need.\nHere is a demo of the fonts in a narrative scene. Vinque is used for the names while Erin Go Bragh is used for dialogue.\n\n\n\nFont Implementation Issues\nFonts and Raylib are an odd combination. It they are not loaded right they look off. I struggled with blurriness on some fonts and others didn’t look quiet right hnece my final choice of fonts.\nMy biggest issue here was special characters. By default not all of the font is loaded. It’s not very well documented. I had to dig through samples to figure out how to load this properly. It was all related to how fonts are loaded and the defaults are not enough. The raylib [text] example - Font loading sample helped me a lot. Once this was sorted out the game looked a lot better."

Other options can be added at a later date.\n\n\n\nCredits\nAttributes my work and assets I sourced from other places. Also thanks all of the people that have supported me during this project.\n\n\n\nThoughts on the menus\nOriginally, I had scrapped the idea of doing an options menu for the beta but after seeing the minimal effort involved in extending the controls menu I brought it back into scope. Credits wasn’t considered before but since some music assets have been sourced it made sense to attribute everyone in some way.\nThese menus may be basic but they serve a purpose making them a worth while addition to the game. They may not be the prettiest looking but they are consistent which makes them feel like they belong."
