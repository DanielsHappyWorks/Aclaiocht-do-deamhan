This week I managed to add 2 features to the game: the character selection and player movement on the overworld.

# Character Selection

The character selection uses UI elements from [Raygui](https://github.com/raysan5/raygui) which made the development a lot faster.
The visuals on this menu could use some work and maybe revisited in the future if time allows but the menu itself serves its purpose.

While re-watching the demo below, I realised I tried to click on the character directly to select them. I may also need to reconsider some usability aspects of my UI design.

# Player Movement

The player movement works well. The animations can definitely be refined. The glaring issue I'll have to come back to here is re-using the movement in location scenes as currently all code lives in the overworld scene. Small steps will get me where I need to go eventually.

# Short Reflection

To challenge myself, I decided to use raylib with C++ for the project. Using an engine would probably have been a bit faster in retrospect but this is keeping me engaged in the technical aspects. So far, the coding is fun and not too challenging. It was a good idea to focus the thesis on an area I'm less versed in. It helps that I'm already somewhat familiar with raylib through my other project called [House of Cards](https://boopdood.itch.io/house-of-cards).

As I add more, I'm continuously re-factoring and find myself spending a lot of time cleaning up after myself due to some questionable code choices. Time constraints are forcing me to be creative and take some shortcuts so I can keep making visible progress but that seems to be the thing that drives me into a corner causing said re-factors.

# First steps towards a narrative game

The first steps have been taken towards being able to create a narrative game. I still need to do some work around entering locations and spawning NPCs but once this is done I can start working on dialogue engine implementation.

Here is a quick demo of the game so far.
