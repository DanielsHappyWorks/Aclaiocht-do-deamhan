This blog entry discusses the initial concept for a game called "Exercise your Demons".

It is a 2D narrative time management game where you work at a gym and help Fairies from Irish Folklore exercise and overcome their problems.

You befriend the creatures while spotting them at the gym and bumping into them outside of work.

Your goal is to help them improve, overcome their weakness and pass on from this plane of existence.

Failure will have dire consequences for both you and the Fairies.
