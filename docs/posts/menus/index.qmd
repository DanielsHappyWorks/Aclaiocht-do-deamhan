I added 3 menus to the game. They are very rough around the edges but they serve their purpose.

# Controls

Displays the game controls.

# Options

Allows the user to change volume settings for music and sounds. Other options can be added at a later date.

# Credits

Attributes my work and assets I sourced from other places. Also thanks all of the people that have supported me during this project.

# Thoughts on the menus

Originally, I had scrapped the idea of doing an options menu for the beta but after seeing the minimal effort involved in extending the controls menu I brought it back into scope. Credits wasn't considered before but since some music assets have been sourced it made sense to attribute everyone in some way.

These menus may be basic but they serve a purpose making them a worth while addition to the game. They may not be the prettiest looking but they are consistent which makes them feel like they belong.
