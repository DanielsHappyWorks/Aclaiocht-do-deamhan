This is the first project delivery. I took some time to create a demo,
update my timeline and resolve some minor issues to make the game more
appealing.

# Demo

# Reflection

The alpha went really well. I'm very happy with what I delivered. I've overcome many bugs and challenges. Not everything went according to plan but more got done than expected. As part of this delivery, I got some time to re-evaluate the project timeline and scope. I adjusted for things that in retrospect aren't needed for the beta demo.

# Beta

I need to wrap up the game artifact work soon and publish it so I can
attempt to answer my research question.

## Next steps - Prioritized list

-   Finish narrative integration
    -   Pooka
    -   Dullahan
-   Quality of Life improvements. The core of the game is already completed!
    -   Font Readability
    -   Day/Night Mechanic
    -   Needs way to pass time
        -   Spotting mechanic to become default interaction for passing time.
    -   Controls menu/tutorial
    -   Final beta scene
    -   To be continued screen when all narrative events are completed
    -   Visual enhancements

## Project Update

I also updated scope and re-evaluated the timeline based on the work
completed so far. I got more done than expected for the alpha so I will
make testing my main focus for the beta.
