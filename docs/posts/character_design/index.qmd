This week was mostly spent designing the 2D assets. I have made a decision to use physical media scans as the assets in the game. This provided a cool effect for the prototype and I can build on top of that. All assets are colored in using paint markers which gives them a nice mat finish.

Since there is a lot of time constraints for this project I will limit the amount of assets I make and try to re-use as much as possible. This will likely mean no fully animated characters either. For now I expect they will waddle around like South Park characters with limited movement. Time constraints are forcing me to get creative here.

# Characters

After much deliberation I have settled on the core cast of the game. This includes:

- Main Character
- St Patrick
- Pooka
- Banshee
- Dullahan

The cast is still mostly lacking proper names but they will interact in a small fictitious town called Inishsi√≥g in county Galway.

As part of the [Design Document](/design.html) I hope to further refine these.

The main character can be either male or female, the designs are:

The side character designs are:

# Environment

The map is one of a coastal area.

All of the buildings will be separate sprites layered on top of the map. This way they can be highlighted using code later.
